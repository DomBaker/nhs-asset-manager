## Application theme
The application is an asset managing application that allows a user to register an account, manage, and unassign their assets along with having a standard
user privileges and admin user privileges.

## The frontend 
The frontend is heavy based on the [NHSUK frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend)
Also following guidance from [NHS Digital Service Manual](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/)

## Tech stack
- [Python 3.9](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)
- [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
- [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

## Deployment
- [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)

## users

### Admin user
- Email: admin@user.com
- Password: testing123
### standard user
- Email: standard@user.com
- Password: testing123

Also feel free to create your own standard user.

### Dummy users
- Generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)
- Within the application you will find an array of dummy users these accounts can't be logged into as they're there for testing purpose only. The main reason these accounts can't be logged into is because of the pbkdf2_sha256 password verification, because the data has been imported into the database these users passwords have not been hashed, therefore are inaccessible.
